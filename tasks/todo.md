# SOLIDIFY — build plan & log

Full design: `~/.claude/plans/robust-puzzling-emerson.md` (flagship choice, UI/UX identity,
physics model, milestone gates — set in stone before implementation).

## Milestones

- [x] M0 — Vite+TS+WebGPU scaffold, ping-pong compute, gate screen
- [x] M1 — Single Kobayashi dendrite, canonical morphology (verified against '93 figures)
- [x] M2 — Multi-grain: grain-ID claiming, nucleation modes, chill wall, impingement
- [x] M3 — Visual identity: MELT / ORIENT / ETCH / FIELD views, relief lighting, film grain
- [x] M4 — Control rail, presets, HUD sparklines, GPU grain stats + ASTM readout
- [x] M5 — Tour: 6 chapters (Mullins–Sekerka → casting CET → optimizer)
- [x] M6 — "Engineer it": sep-CMA-ES over cooling schedule + nucleation, lab-notebook strip
- [x] M7 — README + hero shots, repo, deploy

## Review

**Verification done (2026-07-19, via Claude-in-Chrome screenshot loop):**
- Dendrite morphology matches Kobayashi: 4 primary arms, noise-gated side branches, tip glow.
- 6-fold switch produces dendritic snowflake.
- 60 rain grains: clean impingement, zero ID bleed, ASTM G 3.2 vs hand-sanity count.
- Optimizer: 27 castings, best |ΔG| 0.50 vs target G 4, thumbnails all real micrographs.
- 60 fps at 1024² on this machine; 2048² works with backpressure throttling.

**Bugs found & fixed during verification:**
1. Wide-stencil Laplacian → checkerboard instability + debris. Fix: compact 9-point Laplacian,
   divergence-form anisotropy via flux texture (the standard discretization).
2. Unbounded GPU submission queue froze the tab at 2048²+turbo. Fix: single submit per frame +
   `onSubmittedWorkDone` backpressure (skip stepping when ≥2 frames in flight) + per-grid substep cap.
3. Chrome suspends rAF in occluded windows — looked like a hang. Not a bug; documented; test hook
   `__solidify.tick(n)` drives frames synthetically.
4. CMA-ES `ask()` returned its internal population array; queue `shift()` emptied it → `tell`
   crash. Fix: copy.
5. Optimizer episode rain was wall-clock-paced (≈13 nuclei/casting, target unreachable). Fix:
   sim-time-paced rain, achievable target band G 1–6.
6. Stale stats poll could finish the *next* episode instantly. Fix: episode-tagged polls.

**Known limits / next:**
- [ ] Dilute-alloy solute mode (Warren–Boettinger) — v1.1 stretch
- [ ] Grain-boundary lines in ETCH are thin/broken while liquid films persist (partly physical)
- [ ] WebGPU only — gate screen with explainer for unsupported browsers (recorded loop TBD)
