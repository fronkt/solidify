/**
 * HYDROGEN POROSITY — dissolved gas rejected on freezing, via Sievert's law.
 *
 * The atmosphere→porosity link used to be a single admitted hack in the lab:
 * "poured in air? add 0.1 to the pore field." This replaces it with the actual
 * mechanism. A molten metal dissolves diatomic hydrogen in proportion to the
 * square root of its partial pressure (Sievert's law, C = S·√p), and the
 * solubility S collapses on freezing — liquid aluminium holds ~19× the hydrogen
 * the solid can. The rejected difference is what nucleates gas pores, which is
 * why aluminium is the textbook gas-porosity casting and why foundries degas.
 *
 * What is real here and what is a proxy, stated plainly (the science page carries
 * the same split):
 *   - REAL: the solubilities hL, hS (Ransley–Neufeld values on `MaterialSI`), the
 *     √p dependence, and the liquid→solid drop that drives the whole effect.
 *   - PROXY: how much hydrogen each atmosphere presents. Air is humid and water
 *     vapour charges the melt (2Al + 3H₂O → Al₂O₃ + 3H₂); a cover gas leaves
 *     residual moisture; a vacuum degasses. The numbers below are an ordering,
 *     not measured partial pressures. And the map from rejected hydrogen to the
 *     pore-field value is a calibration, tuned so a dirty aluminium melt lands
 *     near the old hard-coded bias — but now ordered by atmosphere and zeroed by
 *     a clean one, instead of a flat constant.
 *
 * A material with no solubility data refuses gas-porosity modelling by name,
 * exactly as the heat-treatment refusals do, rather than inventing a number.
 *
 * Pure TypeScript, no DOM — loads browser-free for scripts/verify-porosity.mjs.
